Need service KB article for below proces..

Data Security team will identify the files located in sharepoint and onedrive location whihc contains sensitive information, passwrds, crdetials etc. and generate the report...

then that team will submit the ticket to sharepoint team to do this 

primarily, they need to inform to all the users using email to check out thier list of detected files. the list is located in sharepoint site.

We need to upload the list submitted by the data scurity team to that sharepoint site.

after few weeks they will again open a ticket to delete the files from thier respected locations(sp and od)
